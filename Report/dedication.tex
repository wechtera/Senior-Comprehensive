I'd like to thank, firstly, my professors Kapfhammer, Jumidanova, Roos, and Cupper, for the help they provided me guiding and sparking the interest and passion I hold for programming today.  My mother and father, for being there through the most rewardingly difficult years of my education, as well as my brothers for releasing the tension when it was needed most.  If it weren't for my family, I would never have even made it to the comp so for their drive, I am grateful.  I'd also like to thank my dear friends BJ Nelson, who was a constant pressure and egging on helped me preserveer, Katherine Murray, who's friendship and sense of humor got me through the days, and finally Bridgette McCauley, who always believed in me.
