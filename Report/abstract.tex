Traffic gridlock and delay waste precious resources and is known to be  worsening as populations increase.  This makes alleviating the problem all the more important and drives research to find new, novel techniques to address the many causes of traffic congestion.  This paper offers an evolutionary algorithmic approach to optimizing traffic control devices at intersections to feasibly and affordably reduce total time transit, total time delay, and total fuel consumption of the vehicles.  Extensive configuration trials suggests that this process can contribute to optimize a given system, and points  to future study and modification of these types of algorithms on larger and more realistic city plans. This research delivers a simple, ideal, discrete event simulator, which is able to solve for fitnesses of a traffic system with a user-defined traffic control system configuration, as well as the customized ECJ engine which solves for the highest fitness using the simulator as the evaluator.
